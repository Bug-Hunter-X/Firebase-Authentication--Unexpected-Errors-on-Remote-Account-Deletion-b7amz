# Firebase Authentication: Unexpected Errors on Remote Account Deletion

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Firebase Authentication SDK where unexpected errors occur if a user's account is deleted from the Firebase console while the user remains signed in on a client device. The lack of clear error messages makes debugging challenging.

## Bug Description
When a user's account is deleted remotely, the client SDK might not immediately reflect this change. Subsequent operations may result in cryptic error messages or silent sign-outs, making it difficult to identify the root cause.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Sign in a user using Firebase Authentication.
2. Delete the user's account from the Firebase console.
3. Attempt to perform an action that requires authentication on the client (e.g., fetching data from a secured Realtime Database).

## Solution
Implementing robust error handling and checking the `currentUser` status regularly can help mitigate the issue. The solution code provides an example of more informative error handling and how to manage sign-out scenarios more gracefully.
