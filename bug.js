The Firebase Authentication SDK may throw an unexpected error if the user's account is deleted from the Firebase console while the user is still signed in on a client device.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including silent sign-outs or persistent error messages that are difficult to debug.  The error messages may not clearly indicate the underlying issue of account deletion.
